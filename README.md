# Predix-Basics

## What is Predix? 
* Pronounced Pre-Dix
* Predix is a Software Platform, offered as Platform as a Service by GE Software Center, San Ramon, California. 
* Predix gets its name from the predective capability that applications built on Predix can provide. 
* Like knowing exactly when a part needs to be repaired. This saves customer's time and money. 
* Reduced Unplanned Downtime and Improve Return on Investment. 
* Today's machines like engines, locomoties, and wind turbines have many sensors that can provide real time data about themselves. 
* Predix applications can quickly analyze enormous files and types of data from machines. 
* Connecting to all these machines and  analyze their data to improve the way the world runs is the new way forward - this is something 
we call the Industrial Internet. 
* Industrial internet is all about connecting machines with other machines, and people and knowledge. 
* This is possible not only because of the intelligence of sensors in today's machines but also our ability to capture, transmit and 
analyze massive amount of data quickly and efficiently. 
* Just like your smart phone is a mobile platform that runs apps that we all have come to love. 
* Predix is an industrial platform that can run apps for the industrial world. 
* In software world a platform is an environment in which the software applications are designed to run. 
* Just like a trains platform provides an environment design for trains to operate in. A train platform can provide many services like ticket purchase, boarding, food, etc. A train platform can scale to serve one person to many people safely and efficiently. 
* It offers reliable and repeatable experience. 
* Back to the Smart Phone. It is very successful not because it is easy to use but because of the platform it provides enabling an ecosystem of services to allow applications to be easily and quickly developed to run on it. 
* Thanks to the smart phone platform. The developer of the application won't have to worry about the complexity of the hardware and software. They just focus on buiding the service they want to provide. 
* GE is building the Predix platform like the iOS for the industrial world. 

## What makes Predix unique from other technology platforms? 
* Predix provides industrial level security to protect machines as you connect them to other machines and to the cloud. 
* Predix can ingest any kind of data: 
  1) Structered & Unstructerd data
  2) Email data
  3) Voice data
  4) Field data
  5) Video data
* Predix enables you to run multiple complex combination of analytics fast. 
* It allows multiple users concurrently and exihibits all the latest attributes one would expect in a PaaS offering. 
* Predix is GE's PaaS for the industrial world. 
* Internet connects millions of people. The industrial internet will connect billions of machines. 
* Through those connections we will collect and analyze data, optimize assets and enterprises. 
* Predix is GE's OPEN platform to enable industrial transformation business for GE and other industries. 

## Predix Architecture
Build, Connect, Analyze and Predict

Connectivity - 
* Predix Machine (Software/Analytics) - is a software stack installed locally on gateways, industrial controllers or sensors. It is 
responsible for executing the edge analytics and communicating with the industrial asset as well as the cloud. 
The predix connectivity service enables machines to talk to the cloud even when normal internet is not available, which is common in industrial scenario that offten operate in remote locations. It uses a virtual network comprises of cellular, fixed line and sattelite technologies. 

* The predix cloud privides industrial services that developers can use to build, test and run industrial internet applications. Its based on a custome build cloud data infrastructure. GE carefully specified have security controls and hardware optimized to build the predix workload including worldclass data processing and networking capabilities. 

* At the platform layer we chose cloud foundry because of its vibrant eco system and fast pace innovation. Its also open source which means we can and do optimize it for our use cases. 

* Industrial focused services - 
1) Operations Service - Predix provides DevOps as service. Which provides all the tools required to manage the source code, develop, test and deploy code to the cloud in an automated fashion. This enables developers to rapidly deliver innovations to their customers. 
More importantly, it provides BizOps which enables developers to instrument their code so they understand how it is being used includeing commercializations plans. 

2) Asset Service - is at the center of all the industrail internet application. It enables developers to create and store models of of the assets including their properties, sensor information and relationships between the assets. 

3) Data Service - Developers can then store data about specific asset services through data service. It enables ingest, cleanse, store and mapping. Right data can optimally be stored in the right format. Time Series Data store that is specifically optimized for storing and clearing sensor data.  

4) Analytics Service - create and orchestrate big data analytics and store them in a taxanomy based catalog for reuse. 

5) UI/Mobile Application componenet - provides developers with an application framework to use the services above. As well as a modular design system that provide a context driven user experience. The user gets the data that they need at the time they needed to do their job whether they are an Ops Speciallist in the data center or a technician in the field maintaining a wind turbine. 

6) Application Security Services - User authentication and User autherization when the resources are jet engines and nuclear reactors. 

Industries -
